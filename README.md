# python scripts

This repository contains various scripts written either in [sagemath](https://sagemath.org) or in Python.
To run the scripts that use sagemath you need to install sagemath in your pc or you can use an online 
sage server or you can use sagecell. 
Feel free to comment mistakes or improvements of my code.
