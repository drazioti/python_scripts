In the file attack.py, we provide the code for an attack to (EC)DSA system.
The attack is based on lattices, in fact to BDD.
The code is wriiten in sagemath ver. 8.1.
Also, the code can be easily transfered to fpylll.

Using these code we execute the experiments provided in the paper :
M. Adamoudis, K.A. Draziotis, D. Ppoulakis, Enhansing an attack to DSA schemes.

The paper improves the result of [1] and also improves the results paper [2].

As far as the paper [2], the authors provide an attack using only 100 signatures and 2-MSB for the corresponding
ephemeral keys. Using a BDD with pruning method, they got a success rate 23%. i.e. they found the secret keys for 23% of
their instances. We provide an attack that finds the secret keys of DSA systems, knowing 1-bit of (multiples) of ephemeral keys and knowing 206 signatures, with success rate 62%.
