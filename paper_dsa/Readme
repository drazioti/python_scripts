In attack.py we provide an attack to (EC)DSA system.
The attack is based on lattices, in fact to CVP.

A brief outline of the steps we implemented.

(i)   First we choose  a sequence f_q(n).
(ii)  Then we compute the number of signatures, say n.
(iii) pick some integers A_i in specific intervals
(iv)  Creates the DSA lattices (i.e. a matrix where its rows, generares the lattice)
(v)   Apply Babai

The code is wriiten in sagemath ver. 8.1
