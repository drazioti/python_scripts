There are three files here :

[1] testing_Schnorr_She_method-fpylll.py (uses fpylll library)

[2] branch-and-bound(sage).py (written in sage ver 6.9)

[3] comparison_for_small_solutions(sage).py  (written in sage ver 6.9)

The first one contains the basic experiments of two variants of Schnorr-Shevchenko method.
The second is an heuristic algorithm using branch and bound to solve compact knapsack problem.
The third is a comparison between three algorithms in order to find small solutions of a linear equation, a1x1+...+anxn=s.
